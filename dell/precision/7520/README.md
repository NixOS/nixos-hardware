# Dell Precision 7520

This configuration opts to use the non-free nvidia driver, as UI glitching was often observed with `nouveau` when using
a compositor.

## Doesn't work

- External monitor for luks passphrase entry

## Firmware Upgrades

Note that this device is supported by fwupd. To perform firmware upgrades just activate the service:

```nix
services.fwupd.enable = true;
```

Then use `fwupdmgr` to perform updates

## Nvidia Driver

The choice of the `legacy_390` driver is based on looking for PCI Device ID `10de:1436`. On the [nvidia driver site](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/legacy-gpu/) which should indicate the
driver, the exact device isn't listed. However, we can see
[here](https://linux-hardware.org/?id=pci:10de-1436-103c-1909) has nvidia driver "375.82 and newer" listed. Since the
newest nvidia drivers don't support legacy devices, the closest version newer than 375.82 was chosen.
