= Dell XPS 17 9710 =

There are two major hardware variants. Intel-only and NVidia

This has only been tested with the Intel-only variant

== Firmware Configuration ==

Enter the bios by repeatedly pressing F2 when the laptop turns on

=== Before installation ===

These settings are needed both for booting the final install, and installer itself. Therefore, they must be done first.

==== Method One ====

* Click ''Restore Settings'' button a select ''BIOS Defaults'', not to be confused with ''Factory Settings''

==== Method Two ====

* ''Disable Secure Boot (but keep UEFI Boot).'' Thankfully doing so is as easy as changing any other simple setting.

* ''Disable Intel hardware RAID and use AHCI instead.'' Intel doesn't seem to provide a working linux driver for this

== Optional ==
