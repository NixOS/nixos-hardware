== Notes ==

== NVIDIA Offload ==

In order to run a program on the NVIDIA gpu, you can use the `nvidia-offload` function, for example:
```
nvidia-offload `nix-shell -p glxinfo --run 'glxgears'`
```
This is a short bash script that sets the proper environment variables and calls your command.

== Fingerprint Reader ==

I have added support for the fingerprint reader. It has however been tested on Gnome  only.

- After Installation, I had to reboot once before the fingerprint options  would showin the Users module in Gnome Settings
- You will need to register your fingerprints in the Users module in Gnome Settings
- When logging in I suggest using your password otherwise the keyring is not unlocked at login. You can use the fingerprint reader at all other times.

== Touchpad ==

This is a matter of preference, but I do recommend disabling the Touchpad while typing. I hit it with my palm all the time.

Since I am using Gnome, I have done this through Home-Manager using `dconf`.

```
"org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/touchpad" = {
      disable-while-typing = true;
    };
```
