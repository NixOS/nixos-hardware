# HP Elitebook 830 G6

## solved problems
* KDE Plasma 5 (haven't tested others), ~20% of the time freezes at login screen on resume - setting hardare.enableAllFirmware seems to fix

## Unsolved Problems

* sometimes fails to sleep (seems to be an application causing it, so probably not a driver/kernel problem)
