# HP Laptop 15s-fq1xxxx

Warning: this option set may not be optimized to it's fullest. It's a carbon copy of the 14s-dq2024nf options, with Tiger Lake switched out for Ice Lake.

However, I still wanted to profit from the many optimizations provided by the library, so I'm leaving this as a starting point.

Here's the place I got the information from, they seem to be close enough to one another that not many changes are needed:
