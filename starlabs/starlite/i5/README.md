# [Star Labs StarLite 5 Tablet (I5)](https://starlabs.systems)

Star Labs machines are made for mainline Linux and most things just work!

The StarLite 5 is their first tablet, and the only hardware configuration oddity is an accelerometer that needs enabling and adjusting to rotate the display correctly. See the vendor's note at [support.starlabs.systems](https://support.starlabs.systems/kb/guides/starlite-fixing-rotation-on-older-kernel).
