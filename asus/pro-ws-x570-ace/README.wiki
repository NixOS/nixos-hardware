== Firmware issues ==

=== BIOS ===

BIOS version 4805 (and possibly older) has broken <code>X2APIC</code> mode, which in turn breaks <code>amd-pstate</code> support.
Other possible config values for <code>APIC</code> are <code>Compatibility</code>, <code>Auto</code> and <code>XAPIC</code>; best results were observed with <code>XAPIC</code>.

This is the error in dmesg when <code>X2APIC</code> is enabled:

<code>
amd_pstate: the _CPC object is not present in SBIOS or ACPI disabled
</code>

=== IPMI ===

The IPMI is half-baked and for the most part unusable in a pure Linux environment, see https://forum.level1techs.com/t/remote-management-on-the-asus-pro-ws-x570-ace-under-linux

== Firmware features ==

=== IOMMU ===

The groups are great, it's a good board for VFIO.

=== ECC Memory ===

As stated on the product page, it works; explicitly enabling in BIOS might be required.
Tested with <code>M391A2K43BB1-CTD</code>.
