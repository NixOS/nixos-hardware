I was unable to get the hybrid settings working well with lightdm or sddm, but Optimus Sync
mode seems to work the best for me.

I am running the Linux 6.6 LTS kernel with KDE + SDDM, and it seems to be working well.

## hardware-configuration.nix

I have the following customizations added for my nvidia drivers.

```
hardware.nvidia = {
    nvidiaSettings = true;
    package = config.boot.kernelPackages.nvidiaPackages.stable;
};
```

## Setup at the time of testing
