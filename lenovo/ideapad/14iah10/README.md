# Lenovo IdeaPad 5 Pro / XiaoXin Pro 14 GT (14IAH10)

This module provides configuration common to all Arrow Lake (Core Ultra 200H
series)-based devices and rectifies a few quirks with the system that are mostly
all caused by firmware or BIOS bugs. While the solution isn't perfect, the
laptop is decently usable with these tweaks, including networking and speakers
output.
