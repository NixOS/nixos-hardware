 *
 * This profile just configures the Intel
 * Twin Lake N150 CPU and integrated
 * graphics for this mini-PC. fstrim is also
 * enabled for the SSD. That's all this seemed
 * to need to function properly. As is now
 * expected from Intel NUC systems, it provides
 * a solid "out-of-the-box" experience. No
 * special quirks are apparent.
 *
 * We import the Alder Lake modules since Twin
 * Lake is just a refreshed version of the
 * Alder Lake-N series. Re-using those seems
 * to be fine for this purpose.
