# Apple MacBook Pro 11,1

This configuration is tested on my 13" *MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013),* model number `A1502`.

The 6.11.5 kernel appears to work well with only minor adjustments on this notebook. Note that my machine has a BCM4360 wireless card (PCI-ID `14e4:43a0`) which appears to only work with the nonfree `wl` driver.
