# NixOS on T2 Macs

This is the `nixos-hardware` module of the [T2 Linux Project](https://t2linux.org).

Overall, most features (WiFi, bluetooth, audio, touchbar, ...) of Macs are supported, [see this page](https://wiki.t2linux.org/state/) for a detailed list of things that work and things that don't/partially work.

Following [this guide](https://wiki.t2linux.org/distributions/nixos/installation/) is the recommended way to install, as it incudes the extra things you have to do on a T2 Mac.

You can consult the [wiki](https://wiki.t2linux.org/) for information specific to T2 Macs.
