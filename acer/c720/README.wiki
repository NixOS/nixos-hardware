= Overview =
* Processor: Intel Celeron 2955U @ 1.40GHz
* Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros AR9462

= Configuration =
The C720 comes with a Cypress APA touchpad. Support for this touchpad was added in kernel 3.17-rc1.
In order to get the touchpad working CONFIG_CHROME_PLATFORMS needs to be enabled.

For example, for touchpad support with the 3.18 kernel, the following should be added to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix:

  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_3_18;
  nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs:
    { linux_3_18 = pkgs.linux_3_18.override {
        extraConfig =
          '''''''
            CHROME_PLATFORMS y
          ''''''';
      };
    };
