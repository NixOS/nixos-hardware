# Huawei Matebook X Pro (2020)

This is a very standard device that needs little configuration. The module mainly imports the common modules for its CPU, GPU, SSD etc. and enables ppd for power management. Nvidia prime offload is also enabled. This configuration should work with all Matebook X Pro models from 2020 (MACHC-WA*) other than MACHC-WAH9L as it does not contain the Nvidia GPU.
